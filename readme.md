I created this project to learn PHP (connection between database). For now work on this project has been stoped.

Things that work and where done:

- login
- register
- sessions

Things that were started but haven't been ended:

- reset password

Things that should be:

- responsive design

To see the project:

1. Download the project and move it to folder xampp/htdocs in XAMPP Control Panel files.
2. Create database in localhost and name it something (name of database is important!!! if u will use wrong name, project will not work).
3. Create a user and give him privileges to database (Commands in file notes.txt. Location: assets/sql. Use shell in XAMPP Control Panel to this action).

NOTE!
THIS PROJECT WAS CREATED ONLY TO LEARN PHP.
